</div><div>Beasts are transformations which a character can get and use in a fight. A beast gives its user additional moves which are not in his/her card originally. When someone has a beast it has to be summoned before it's moves can be used.A beast can be obtained by beating it in a battle
</div><div>
</div><div>Ninjas have the tailed beasts while Saiyans have the Oozarus(great apes). There are many different beasts with different strengths and abilities.
</div><div>
</div><div>A player with a beast can be challenged to a battle for that beast, if the weilder agrees and loses, he/she loses their beast to the challenger.  if players without beast battles a player with beast and lose , he dies and user with beast may not partcipate in any beast battle for a week.
</div><div>
</div><div>Even in a beast mode, one can still use their original skills/moves/jutsus.
</div><div>
</div><div>When battling a beast, that beast has an unlimited attack which is not part of it's skill card called nom attack. The nom attack can be used as long as the beast does not have an owner. The nom attack for ninja beasts give 2hp damage while the beasts of saiyans give 3hp damage.
</div><div>
</div><div>When a beast battle is ongoing and the number of turns has reached 15, the beast regains all its used skills back, this also occurs at an arithmetic rate of turns (i.e turn 30, turn 45, etc), this applies only if the beast has no owner.
</div><div>
</div><div>The Health and Chakra points of an unowned beast is stated on the skill card on this site, as well as the amount of hp &amp; cp gained when it is summoned by an owner.
</div><div>
</div><div>The max number of people that can face one beast at a time is 2 and if more people face the beast and its defeated ,it is not given to anyone.
</div><div>
</div><div>//beasts can only be summoned after the users 3rd turn
</div><div>
</div><div>Fighting an unowned beast and losing will means you die and lose crowns .
</div><div>
</div><div>A player can only posses one beast at a time.</div><br><div>demon beasts commandment cant affect another demon beast.</div><br>de<br><div>
