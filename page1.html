                                   SKILLS
<br>
<br>When you have gotten a character card, the actions or the skills(except KKGs) which are on your card can be found here. Skills can be aquired using xPs. The xPs of skills are stated at the end of the context.
<br>they are classes of skills;<br>melee skills, ranged skills, physical(unarmed and weapon skill)skills.<br><strong>TYPES OF SKILLS
</strong><br>There are 6 different type of skills the skill type is stated in a bracket after the name of the skill. The 6 types are as follows;
<br>
<br>(trap)Trap Skill: these are skills that activate when a certain condition is met either in opponents or users turn although user can choose to activate it or not. they are somtimes called reation or bonus actions.<br>
<br>(atk) Attacking Skill: these type of skills mainly deal damage to opponents
<br>
<br>(time) Time Skill: these are skills that take more than one turn to fufll their purpose
<br>
<br>(def) Defensive Skill: these are skills that prevent you from losing hp such as sheild ,barriers etc
<br>
<br>(neg) Neglecting Skill: these skills stop effect of other skills based on the condition
<br>
<br>(gain) Gain Skill: these types of skill increase your stats, hp or cp or even allow you play more than once.<br><br>attack types are
<br>unarmed attacks: when you use skills that dont use weapons and also dont use cp. this is regarded as a physical attack cause it doesnt use cp
<br>melee attack: when you use skills that require melee weapons but doesnt use cp. this is regarded as a physical attact cause it doesnt use cp.
<br>ranged attack: when you use skills that require ranged weapons but doesnt use cp. this is regarded as a physical attack cause it doesnt use cp. 
<br>charged unarmed attacks: when you use skills that dont use weapons but uses cp. this is regarded as a non physical attack cause it uses cp

<br>
<br>they are also physical time skills and others , not only attacks. and direct and splash/ area of effect attack. direct attack targets only 1 person, while area attacks target more than 1.<br><br>
You can only use a particular skill once, unless it is stated in the description of the skill that it can be used more than once. But some skills take turns to recharge for use again thuo.A skill can be wasted, which means, if the move is used in a wrong situation, the move is counted but will have no effect in the battle.<br>
<br>A skill slot is a free zone in your card that skills can be kept.<br>Note: A skill slot can only hold one skill, but when the slot holds a mode, it can contain 3 modes.If a turn is skipped you lose 2hp but gain 2cp.To use a skill against a player, will be explained later on. <br><br>players can sell skills for half the XPs it is worth. they are also skills that require certain weapons to be able to use them
<br>
<br>Note if your hands are cut off you wont be able to use skills that requires hand, the admin will be the judge of such skills. Physical skills are skills like punch ,kick, non enchanted weapon skills and so on that don’t use cp.<br></p>

</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Terms:
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Card- This holds your skills/moves. This is what you use in-battle. When you first join, you have a card that has the following moves, punch,kick,kkg,and others. your initial slots are detemine by your race.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>slots(a slot can be bought with 15xp, max number of slots is varies with race). Every player has a card, do not show other players your card(except from admins) so your moves will not be predictable.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Skills/Moves/Justu- These are what you use in battle. You use the moves given in your card to fight. Moves can also  be bought using xp. There are special moves(KKG) which cannot be bought and cannot be changed when you are given in your card.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Battle- This is a fight between players in the game, there are different types of battles, including one-on-one, two-on-two(tag team), friendly battle, death batlle, beast battle, tounament battle, etc. A battle is won when a player reduces his/her opponenets health to zero.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Health(HP)- This differs depending on your race(more about this in the Races &amp; Villages section). This is an essential factor because if an opponent depletes this completely during a battle, that battle is lost.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Charge Points(CP)- This is the amount of energy one has. This is needed to perform most moves, it also differs depending on your race. If your cp drops to zero during a battle, you can skip a turn and gain 2cp, but you lose 2hp in the process as well. note that ki, chakra and others a summarized as cp in this game

Increasing your rank increases the amount of health and charge points you have at the start of a battle. has you lose battle you lose crowns, which can make you go down in rank and decrease your already gotten buffs
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>dying- when you die you have to wait for the number of days according to your rank for you to revive and continue gaming. while dead you cannot not play online battles or download online content like new story mode and other. you can pay 2xp for each day left to reduce your death sentence.
